Speech emotion recognition is a technology that involves analyzing audio signals to detect and classify the emotions expressed in speech. It uses techniques from signal processing, machine learning, and natural language processing to identify emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, or neutrality based on the acoustic features of speech. The goal is to develop systems that can automatically recognize and respond to the emotional cues conveyed in human speech, enabling applications in fields such as human-computer interaction, customer service, and mental health monitoring.
